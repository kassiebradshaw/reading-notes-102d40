# My Reading Notes!

*This is where I'm going to put my reading assignments.*

**Growth mindset is my own perception of my abilities. I can keep improving with determination, perseverence, practice, etc.**

**Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:**
1. Sucking at something's the first step to bein' sorta good at something
2. Put your mask on first, you can't help others if you don't take care of yourself.
3. Whenever I'm struggling, remember no one else is walking in my shoes. This is MY journey!
4. Try to focus on what's possible, not excuses. We can always find reasons why NOT, but it'll be helpful to find reasons why YES!
